# Tableau Projects
This repository showcases my data visualization and analysis projects using Tableau. The current focus includes two case studies: a Telecom Customer Churn analysis and a FIFA Football dataset exploration. Each project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, helping businesses make informed, data-driven decisions.

**Telecom Customer Churn Analysis:** In this project, I analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company. Using Tableau, I explore customer demographics, usage patterns, and service subscriptions to identify the key factors driving churn. The project includes segmentation of customers, churn rate trends, and a customer journey analysis, aiming to provide actionable strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

**FIFA Football Insights:** This project leverages Tableau to explore a comprehensive FIFA football dataset. The analysis covers player attributes, team performance, and match statistics, aiming to uncover patterns and insights that can support strategic decisions in football management. It includes visualizations on player demographics, skill ratings, wages, and nationalities, along with trend analysis over the years.

**Future Projects:** This repository will continue to evolve with additional data visualization and analysis projects across various domains, such as business intelligence, healthcare, finance, and sports analytics. The goal is to showcase a diverse set of projects that demonstrate my ability to work with large datasets, conduct exploratory data analysis, and provide valuable insights through interactive visualizations and dashboards.
